# Bunny Themes!

Hey There! I recently have been playing around with the popular discord client; Bunny and have discovered how to make custom themes.

## Examples

1. ![1000028434](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed74ead-1f86-41ff-907c-4c14f5af6523)
2. ![1000028432](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4214a492-01cb-4e66-813a-50abb13bd281)



## Installation
1. Choose any .json file for the theme you want!
2. Once you've, chosen select this file and open it.
3. In the top right corner you will see a button called "Raw' click it and then it should take you to a page with just the code.
4. Copy the url.
5. Paste this url into the themes section in bunny (Settings>Bunny>Themes)
6. Your all set! 

Enjoy!
